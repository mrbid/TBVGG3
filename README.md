# Tiny Binary VGG3 (TBVGG3)
A simple convnet based on the VGG network, repurposed for auto-trigger in First Person Shooter games. 

`[14/01/21]` - Finished [`TBVGG3_NAG.h`](https://github.com/TFCNN/Projects/blob/main/TBVGG3_NAG.h) & [`TBVGG3_SGD.h`](https://github.com/TFCNN/Projects/blob/main/TBVGG3_SGD.h) a VGG FCN implementation for binary classification.<br>
`[17/01/21]` - Added real-time dataset logger [`fps_dataset_logger.c`](https://github.com/TFCNN/Projects/blob/main/fps_dataset_logger.c) for offline training.<br>
`[17/01/21]` - Added offline trainer [`fps_offline_training.c`](https://github.com/TFCNN/Projects/blob/main/fps_offline_training.c).<br>
`[18/01/21]` - Successful offline training against Counter Terrorist player models [`dataset & weights`](https://github.com/TFCNN/Projects/blob/main/counter_terrorist_dataset_and_weights.zip).<br>
`[22/01/21]` - Forked improved [`desperate.c`](https://github.com/Quake3Aimbot/Perceptron-Autoshoot/blob/master/desperate.c) to [`quake3_bluebones_autoshoot.c`](https://github.com/TFCNN/Projects/blob/main/quake3_bluebones_autoshoot.c).<br>
